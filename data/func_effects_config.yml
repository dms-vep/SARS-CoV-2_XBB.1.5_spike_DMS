    Interactive plot of the effects of mutations. Negative values indicated deleterious mutations,
    positive values indicate beneficial mutations for the measured phenotype.

    Use the site zoom bar at the top to zoom in on specific sites. The line plot shows a summary
    statistic indicating the effects of mutations at each site. The heat map shows the effects of
    individual mutations, with parental amino-acid identities indicated by x and gray
    indicating non-measured mutations.

    You can mouse over points to get details about individual measurements, include measurements
    in individual selection experiments.

    The options at the bottom of the plot let you modify the display, such as by selecting how
    many different variants a mutation must be seen in to be shown (*minimum times_seen*),
    how many different experimental selections the mutation was measured in
    (*minimum n_selections*), what site summary statistic to show, etc.

    The *minimum max of effect* at site is useful to select the sites where mutations have
    the most positive functional effects.
