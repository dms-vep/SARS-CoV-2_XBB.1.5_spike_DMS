# Datasets of effects of mutations for comparison to natural evolution

[EVEscape_XBB_single_mutation_predictions.csv](EVEscape_XBB_single_mutation_predictions.csv) is the data for the single mutation effects to XBB as estimated by EVEscape. This is the file downloaded on Oct-24-2023 from [https://evescape.org/data](https://evescape.org/data) for XBB using the `Mutation Data for Omicron(XBB)` box (which is [this download link](https://api.evescape.org/download_variant_data?curr-virus=COVID19&curr-variant-or-id=Omicron(XBB))). The downloaded file was then edited to remove the `mutations` column (which is very long) and rename the `wt`, `pos`, and `mut` columns to be called `wildtype`, `site`, and `mutant`.

[incremental_Hamming_distance_from_Wuhan-Hu-1.csv](incremental_Hamming_distance_from_Wuhan-Hu-1.csv) just gives a value of one to every mutation that is different from the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike, taken from [QHD43416.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/QHD43416.1).

[yeast_RBD_DMS.csv](yeast_RBD_DMS.csv) was created by taking the XBB.1.5 ACE2 affinity and RBD expression deep mutational scanning data from [supplementary file 1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/09/12/2023.09.11.557279/DC1/embed/media-1.csv?download=true) of [Taylor and Starr, bioRxiv, 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.11.557279v1), and the site escape values from the [SARS2-RBD-escape-calc commit 5ebb88e](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-RBD-escape-calc/tree/5ebb88e5b8c9adc1b601b3cb1cc5308532d97a38), computing the escape for each mutation with the default configuration using `escapecalculator.py` script in the repo (this is neutralization weighted escape in the XBB background).
